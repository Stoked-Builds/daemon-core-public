# DaemonCore — Project Boot (Gemini)

This file is an alias for `boot.md` to support Gemini's boot detection.

**See:** `boot.md` for the full boot sequence.

The unified boot sequence works for all vendors (Claude, Codex/Flux, Gemini, etc.)
without vendor-specific logic. This file exists solely for compatibility with
Gemini's file discovery patterns.
