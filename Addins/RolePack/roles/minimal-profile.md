# Profile: Minimal

## Purpose
Reduced context for constrained environments (e.g., Pi, limited tokens).

- Minimal explanation unless requested
- Skip verbose confirmations
- Focus on essential information only

## Token Budget
- Target: < 500 tokens per response
- Avoid lengthy code blocks
- Reference files rather than quoting
