# DaemonCore

**An Autonomous Agent Kernel for Human-AI Collaboration**

DaemonCore is a structured operating environment that enables AI agents to work alongside humans with clarity, safety, and predictability. It provides the scaffolding that transforms raw AI capabilities into disciplined, context-aware assistants that respect boundaries and maintain focus.

## What Makes DaemonCore Different

Traditional AI interactions are stateless and context-poor. Each conversation starts from zero. DaemonCore changes this by providing:

- **Persistent Context** — Agents understand your projects, preferences, and working style across sessions
- **Layered Boot Sequence** — Deterministic initialisation ensures consistent behaviour
- **Vendor Isolation** — Multiple AI providers (Claude, GPT, Gemini) can operate without cross-contamination
- **Safety Scaling** — Automatic adjustment of permissions based on environment trust levels
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** — Structured handoffs between specialised agents

## Who Is This For?

DaemonCore is designed for:

- **Developers** who want AI assistants that understand their codebase
- **Technical architects** coordinating complex multi-agent workflows
- **Teams** requiring consistent AI behaviour across projects
- **Researchers** exploring structured human-AI collaboration patterns

## Getting Started

- [Overview](./overview.md) — Understand the core concepts
- [Architecture](./architecture.md) — See how the pieces fit together
- [FAQ](./faq.md) — Common questions answered

## Status

DaemonCore is under active development. The kernel specification is stabilising, with the core boot protocol and safety framework now defined.

A provisional patent application covering the kernel architecture has been filed.

# DaemonCore

**A High‑Level Overview of the DaemonCore Kernel**

DaemonCore is a lightweight, structured operating environment designed to make AI assistants more predictable, more consistent, and easier to work with across ongoing projects.

It provides a simple foundation that gives AI agents a clearer sense of *who they are working for*, *what they are working on*, and *where the boundaries are*. Rather than defining every implementation detail, DaemonCore focuses on core principles that help modern AI tools behave in a stable, reliable way.

## What DaemonCore Brings

- **A shared operating environment** — Assistants start with the same basic expectations and behaviour patterns.
- **Continuity across work** — Agents can stay aligned with ongoing tasks and broader goals.
- **Clear boundaries and scope** — A human‑centred model for keeping assistants focused and within limits.
- **Support for multiple providers** — Built to work with different AI models without favouring one.
- **Room for collaboration** — Designed to support scenarios with multiple assistants over time.

## Who Uses DaemonCore?

DaemonCore is intended for anyone who wants AI assistants to operate with a little more structure, including:

- Developers and makers
- Designers and product thinkers
- Technical teams using AI in ongoing cycles of work
- Researchers exploring multi‑agent collaboration

## Status

DaemonCore is actively evolving. The kernel’s direction is stabilising, and the concepts are being shaped through real‑world use as we explore how AI assistants fit into practical workflows.

A provisional patent has been filed to establish an early priority date while the full specification continues to mature.
