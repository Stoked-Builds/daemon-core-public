# DaemonCore

**An Autonomous Agent Kernel for Human-AI Collaboration**

DaemonCore is a structured operating environment that enables AI agents to work alongside humans with clarity, safety, and predictability. It provides the scaffolding that transforms raw AI capabilities into disciplined, context-aware assistants that respect boundaries and maintain focus.

## What Makes DaemonCore Different

Traditional AI interactions are stateless and context-poor. Each conversation starts from zero. DaemonCore changes this by providing:

- **Persistent Context** — Agents understand your projects, preferences, and working style across sessions
- **Layered Boot Sequence** — Deterministic initialisation ensures consistent behaviour
- **Vendor Isolation** — Multiple AI providers (Claude, GPT, Gemini) can operate without cross-contamination
- **Safety Scaling** — Automatic adjustment of permissions based on environment trust levels
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** — Structured handoffs between specialised agents

## Who Is This For?

DaemonCore is designed for:

- **Developers** who want AI assistants that understand their codebase
- **Technical architects** coordinating complex multi-agent workflows
- **Teams** requiring consistent AI behaviour across projects
- **Researchers** exploring structured human-AI collaboration patterns

## Status

DaemonCore is under active development. The kernel specification is stabilising, with the core boot protocol and safety framework now defined.

A provisional patent application covering the kernel architecture has been filed.
