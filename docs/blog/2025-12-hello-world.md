# Hello World: Introducing DaemonCore

*December 2025*

After months of development and refinement, we're ready to share DaemonCore with the world.

## What We've Built

DaemonCore is an autonomous agent kernel — a structured framework that transforms how AI agents operate within human workflows. It's the missing infrastructure layer that makes AI assistants genuinely useful for complex, ongoing work.

## Why This Matters

Current AI tools are remarkably capable but frustratingly stateless. Every conversation starts fresh. There's no memory, no consistent behaviour, no safety boundaries that adapt to context.

DaemonCore changes this. It provides:

- **Persistent context** that survives across sessions
- **Deterministic boot sequences** that ensure predictable behaviour
- **Safety scaling** that matches permissions to trust levels
- **Multi-agent coordination** for complex workflows

## The Road Here

This project grew from a simple frustration: AI assistants that couldn't remember what we were working on. What started as a personal productivity hack evolved into a full kernel architecture as we discovered how much structure was needed to make AI agents truly reliable.

The kernel specification has been refined through real-world use across multiple projects. The patterns that survived are the ones that actually work.

## What's Next

We're publishing the public documentation and specification for review. The goal is to establish DaemonCore as a reference architecture for structured human-AI collaboration.

A provisional patent application has been filed to protect the core innovations while we determine the right path forward for commercial use.

## Get Involved

Review the [documentation](/docs/), explore the [architecture](/docs/architecture.md), and reach out if you're interested in collaboration or commercial licensing.

The future of AI assistance is structured, safe, and human-centred. DaemonCore is our contribution to making that future real.
