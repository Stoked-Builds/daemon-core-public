# Patent Summary

A provisional patent application has been filed covering the DaemonCore kernel architecture.

## What the Filing Covers

The provisional application describes a system and method for:

1. **Structured AI agent initialisation** through a layered boot sequence
2. **Vendor-isolated persona management** preventing cross-model contamination
3. **Adaptive safety scaling** based on execution environment characteristics
4. **Deterministic context loading** for predictable agent behaviour
5. **Multi-agent coordination** through structured exchange protocols

## Key Innovations

The filing focuses on the architectural patterns that enable:

- Consistent agent behaviour across sessions and environments
- Safe delegation of increasingly autonomous operations
- Seamless switching between AI providers
- Human oversight at appropriate trust boundaries

## What This Means

The provisional filing establishes a priority date for these innovations while the full patent application is prepared.

The DaemonCore kernel specification and reference implementations remain available for evaluation and non-commercial use. Commercial licensing terms will be established as the project matures.

# Patent Summary

A provisional patent application has been filed covering the foundational concepts behind the DaemonCore kernel.

## What the Filing Covers

The application outlines the high‑level architectural ideas that define how DaemonCore provides:

1. A structured, repeatable way for assistants to start a session
2. Clear separation between different AI providers
3. A human‑centred approach to boundaries and safety
4. Predictable loading of agent context
5. Support for situations where multiple assistants participate in the same stream of work

These ideas describe a conceptual operating layer rather than specific implementation details.

## Core Innovations

The filing highlights the patterns that enable:

- More stable, repeatable AI assistant behaviour  
- Seamless use of multiple AI providers within the same environment  
- Clear guardrails that preserve human control  
- Scalable collaboration across evolving workflows  

## What This Means

The provisional filing establishes a priority date while the broader design continues to mature. It allows the concepts to be shared and discussed publicly while protecting the underlying innovation.

Commercial licensing terms will be introduced as the technology reaches a stable release.
