# Patent Summary

A provisional patent application has been filed covering the DaemonCore kernel architecture.

## What the Filing Covers

The provisional application describes a system and method for:

1. **Structured AI agent initialisation** through a layered boot sequence
2. **Vendor-isolated persona management** preventing cross-model contamination
3. **Adaptive safety scaling** based on execution environment characteristics
4. **Deterministic context loading** for predictable agent behaviour
5. **Multi-agent coordination** through structured exchange protocols

## Key Innovations

The filing focuses on the architectural patterns that enable:

- Consistent agent behaviour across sessions and environments
- Safe delegation of increasingly autonomous operations
- Seamless switching between AI providers
- Human oversight at appropriate trust boundaries

## What This Means

The provisional filing establishes a priority date for these innovations while the full patent application is prepared.

The DaemonCore kernel specification and reference implementations remain available for evaluation and non-commercial use. Commercial licensing terms will be established as the project matures.
