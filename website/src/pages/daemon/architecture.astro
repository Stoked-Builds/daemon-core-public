    <h1>DaemonCore Architecture</h1>

    <p>
      This page gives a high-level view of how DaemonCore fits together. It is not a
      full technical specification. The aim is to explain the main ideas without
      getting into implementation detail.
    </p>

    <h2>A Simple Mental Model</h2>
    <p>
      You can think of DaemonCore as giving each assistant three things before it
      starts work:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a <strong>basic rulebook</strong> for how it should behave;</li>
      <li>a <strong>sense of scope</strong> – what is in-bounds and out-of-bounds; and</li>
      <li>a <strong>clear focus</strong> – which project and area it is currently helping with.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Those three ideas show up in the architecture as three broad layers: structure,
      boundaries, and coordination.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The structural layer covers how assistants start up and what they see when they
      first "wake up" under DaemonCore. It includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the core rules that apply to all assistants;</li>
      <li>any relevant high-level preferences; and</li>
      <li>a simple notion of who they are there to help and in what capacity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is what makes assistants feel more consistent over time instead of changing
      character between sessions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Boundaries</h2>
    <p>
      The boundaries layer is about safety and scope. Different environments carry
      different levels of trust, and DaemonCore is designed to reflect that. In
      practice, that means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>being clear about which areas of work an assistant is involved in;</li>
      <li>deciding what it is allowed to suggest, change, or trigger; and</li>
      <li>keeping a human firmly in the loop for anything sensitive or irreversible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The intent is to give you more confidence in where assistants can and cannot go,
      rather than leaving it to chance.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Coordination</h2>
    <p>
      Many of the most interesting use cases involve more than one assistant over
      time. The coordination layer focuses on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>handing work off between assistants without losing the thread;</li>
      <li>avoiding situations where two assistants unknowingly work at cross-purposes; and</li>
      <li>leaving a lightweight trail of what happened and why.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is not about complex choreography. It is about giving assistants enough
      structure to feel like they are part of the same team rather than separate,
      isolated tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Extending the Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      DaemonCore is deliberately designed to be extended. Different teams and
      environments will want to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>define their own kinds of roles and assistant "shapes";</li>
      <li>tune how strict or relaxed boundaries should be in different contexts; and</li>
      <li>plug existing tools and workflows into the operating model.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All of this can happen without changing the core promises: predictable start-up,
      clear boundaries, and humans staying firmly in control of the work.
