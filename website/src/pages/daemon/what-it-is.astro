    <h1>What DaemonCore Is</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      DaemonCore is a <strong>governance layer</strong> for multi-agent AI systems.
      It sits beneath orchestration frameworks and defines what agents are allowed to do.
    </p>

    <h2>The Governance Layer</h2>
    <p>
      In traditional software, the operating system enforces boundaries. Applications
      cannot exceed their permissions. Memory is isolated. Resources are managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI systems lack this layer. Agents operate with advisory guidelines, not
      structural constraints. Orchestrators coordinate tasks, but nothing enforces
      the rules they operate under.
    </p>
    <p>
      DaemonCore provides this missing governance layer. It defines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Capability envelopes</strong> — what agents are allowed to do</li>
      <li><strong>Safety boundaries</strong> — constraints that cannot be bypassed</li>
      <li><strong>Coordination protocols</strong> — how agents interact without collision</li>
      <li><strong>Identity isolation</strong> — separation between different AI providers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where It Sits</h2>
    <p>
      DaemonCore operates at a specific layer in the AI stack:
    </p>

    <div class="stack-inline">
      <div class="stack-row">Applications <span class="stack-note">— interfaces, tools, automation</span></div>
      <div class="stack-row">Orchestration <span class="stack-note">— frameworks that coordinate agents</span></div>
      <div class="stack-row stack-highlight">Governance <span class="stack-note">— DaemonCore: safety, boundaries, rules</span></div>
      <div class="stack-row">Models <span class="stack-note">— the underlying AI capabilities</span></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      This position is critical. Governance must sit <em>beneath</em> orchestration
      to enforce rules that orchestrators cannot override.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Functions</h2>

    <h3>Safety Boundaries</h3>
    <p>
      Agents operate within defined capability envelopes. These boundaries are
      architectural, not advisory. An agent cannot exceed its permissions regardless
      of how it's prompted.
    </p>

    <h3>Deterministic Boot</h3>
    <p>
      Agents initialise through a defined boot sequence. Context loads in layers.
      State is explicit at every step. Given identical inputs, agents behave identically.
    </p>

    <h3>Vendor Isolation</h3>
    <p>
      Different AI providers operate under unified governance without cross-contamination.
      Claude, GPT, Gemini, and open-source models can work together while maintaining
      strict separation of context and state.
    </p>

    <h3>Multi-Agent Coordination</h3>
    <p>
      When multiple agents work on related tasks, DaemonCore manages context handoff,
      prevents conflicts, and maintains shared state through defined protocols.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Enables</h2>
    <p>
      With a governance layer in place, organisations can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trust agent behavior</strong> — boundaries are enforced, not hoped for</li>
      <li><strong>Scale safely</strong> — add agents without expanding risk surface</li>
      <li><strong>Switch providers</strong> — change models without restructuring</li>
      <li><strong>Audit operations</strong> — every action traces to defined permissions</li>
    </ul>
