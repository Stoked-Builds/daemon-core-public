    <h1>What is DaemonCore?</h1>

    <p>
      DaemonCore is an <strong>autonomous agent kernel</strong>: a small, opinionated
      layer that sits between AI models and your actual work. It gives assistants a
      shared sense of who they are working for, what they are working on, and how
      they are expected to behave.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is not to build yet another interface. The goal is to give the AI tools
      you already use a more stable, trustworthy operating environment.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem It Tackles</h2>
    <p>
      Today's AI assistants are impressive, but in day-to-day use they often feel like
      amnesiac freelancers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No real continuity</strong> – every session starts like a first meeting.</li>
      <li><strong>No stable character</strong> – behaviour can change between runs.</li>
      <li><strong>No clear limits</strong> – it is hard to see what they can and cannot touch.</li>
      <li><strong>No teamwork</strong> – multiple agents rarely share context cleanly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      DaemonCore exists to bring more structure to that picture. It does not replace
      your favourite models. It wraps them in a simple, consistent way of working.
    </p>

    <h2>How DaemonCore Helps</h2>
    <p>
      When an agent runs under DaemonCore, it does not just receive a one-off prompt.
      It boots into a small stack of information: your broad preferences, the current
      project, and the task or area it should be focusing on.
    </p>
    <p>
      That stack is designed to be predictable. If you run the same kind of work again
      in future, you should be able to reason about how the agent will behave.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>

    <h4>Predictable Start-Up</h4>
    <p>
      DaemonCore is opinionated about how assistants "come online". It encourages a
      repeatable start-up flow so that you spend less time re-explaining context and
      more time actually moving work forward.
    </p>

    <h4>Model-Agnostic</h4>
    <p>
      The kernel is designed to support multiple AI providers. You can mix and match
      models over time while keeping the same broad rules and expectations in place.
    </p>

    <h4>Awareness of Where It's Running</h4>
    <p>
      Environments differ. A locked-down machine, a personal laptop, and a cloud
      workspace do not carry the same level of trust. DaemonCore is built to take
      that into account when shaping how much freedom an assistant has.
    </p>

    <h4>Boundaries First</h4>
    <p>
      Instead of starting from "anything is allowed unless blocked", DaemonCore leans
      towards constrained by default. You decide how far assistants are allowed to go
      and when a human needs to stay in the loop.
    </p>

    <h4>Continuity Within Reason</h4>
    <p>
      Within sensible limits, DaemonCore lets assistants carry forward what has already
      been agreed on a project so you are not constantly starting from zero. The aim
      is to feel more like a teammate catching up, not a stranger dropping in.
    </p>

    <h2>What DaemonCore Is Not</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not an AI model</strong> – it works alongside the models you already use.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a UI product</strong> – it focuses on behaviour, structure, and boundaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a bag of prompts</strong> – it defines an operating environment, not tricks.</li>
      <li><strong>Not tied to one vendor</strong> – it is meant to support a changing landscape.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Predictability</strong> – similar situations should lead to similar behaviour.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency</strong> – assistants should be clear about who they are and where they are running.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety first</strong> – boundaries are a feature, not an optional extra.</li>
      <li><strong>Composability</strong> – small pieces that can be wired into different setups.</li>
      <li><strong>Human control</strong> – important calls stay with humans, not hallucinations.</li>
    </ol>
