    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>
      Daemon Core is an <strong>autonomous agent kernel</strong>: a structural layer
      between AI models and operational workloads. It provides agents with consistent
      context, defined boundaries, and coordination protocols.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose is not interface. The purpose is substrate. A deterministic
      foundation for multi-agent computation.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Current AI systems lack architectural discipline:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No continuity</strong> – each session initialises without context.</li>
      <li><strong>No consistency</strong> – behavior varies between invocations.</li>
      <li><strong>No boundaries</strong> – scope constraints are advisory, not structural.</li>
      <li><strong>No coordination</strong> – multiple agents cannot share state cleanly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Daemon Core addresses these through architectural constraints, not prompt engineering.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Agents under Daemon Core do not receive isolated prompts. They boot into
      a structured context stack: global preferences, project state, task scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stack is deterministic. Given identical inputs, agent behavior is predictable.
    </p>

    <h3>Core Mechanisms</h3>

    <h4>Boot Sequence</h4>
    <p>
      Agents follow a defined initialisation protocol. Context loads in layers.
      State is explicit at every step. No implicit assumptions.
    </p>

    <h4>Vendor Isolation</h4>
    <p>
      Each AI provider operates within isolated configuration. No cross-contamination.
      Models can be substituted without restructuring.
    </p>

    <h4>Environment Awareness</h4>
    <p>
      Agents report execution context at boot. Hardware constraints, network access,
      available tooling. Behavior adapts to environment parameters.
    </p>

    <h4>Safety Scaling</h4>
    <p>
      Permissions correlate with environment trust. Constrained environments receive
      restricted capabilities. High-trust deployments may operate with greater autonomy.
    </p>

    <h4>Session Persistence</h4>
    <p>
      Context persists within defined boundaries. Agents resume from established state.
      No repeated context reconstruction.
    </p>

    <h2>Negative Definition</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not an AI model</strong> – operates alongside existing models.</li>
      <li><strong>Not an interface</strong> – focuses on behavior, not presentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Not prompt engineering</strong> – defines runtime environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Not vendor-specific</strong> – designed for multi-provider operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Determinism</strong> – identical inputs produce identical behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency</strong> – agents declare state and capabilities explicitly.</li>
      <li><strong>Constraint-first</strong> – restrictions are default; permissions are earned.</li>
      <li><strong>Composability</strong> – components combine without modification.</li>
      <li><strong>Human authority</strong> – critical decisions require human approval.</li>
    </ol>
