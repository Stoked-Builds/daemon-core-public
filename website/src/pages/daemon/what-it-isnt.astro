  <article class="article">
    <h1>What DaemonCore Is Not</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Understanding what DaemonCore <em>isn't</em> helps clarify what it is.
      These are the most common misconceptions.
    </p>

    <div class="not-item">
      <h2>Not an AI Model</h2>
      <p>
        DaemonCore does not generate text, reason about problems, or produce outputs.
        It operates <em>alongside</em> existing models — Claude, GPT, Gemini, open-source LLMs.
        These models do the reasoning. DaemonCore provides the governance layer they operate within.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="not-item">
      <h2>Not an Orchestrator</h2>
      <p>
        Orchestrators like LangChain, CrewAI, or AutoGen coordinate agent workflows.
        They decide which agent does what and when. DaemonCore operates <em>beneath</em>
        orchestrators. It defines what agents are <em>allowed</em> to do, not what they
        <em>should</em> do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it this way: orchestrators manage traffic flow; DaemonCore defines the roads.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="not-item">
      <h2>Not an Agent Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Agent frameworks provide scaffolding for building AI agents — memory management,
        tool integration, conversation handling. DaemonCore doesn't build agents. It governs
        agents built with <em>any</em> framework.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="not-item">
      <h2>Not Prompt Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Prompt engineering operates per-request. You craft instructions and hope the
        model follows them. DaemonCore operates at the <em>environment</em> level:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Constraints are structural, not advisory</li>
        <li>Boundaries persist across sessions</li>
        <li>Rules cannot be talked around</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Prompts still exist. They execute <em>within</em> the DaemonCore environment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="not-item">
      <h2>Not a Chatbot or Interface</h2>
      <p>
        DaemonCore has no user interface. It doesn't chat. It doesn't respond to queries.
        It's infrastructure — the governance layer that other systems build upon.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="not-item">
      <h2>Not Vendor-Specific</h2>
      <p>
        DaemonCore is designed for multi-vendor operation. It's not tied to OpenAI,
        Anthropic, Google, or any specific provider. Different models operate under
        unified governance with strict isolation between them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="not-item">
      <h2>Not a Security Product</h2>
      <p>
        While DaemonCore enforces safety boundaries, it's not a security tool in the
        traditional sense. It doesn't scan for vulnerabilities or block attacks.
        It provides <em>architectural</em> safety — ensuring agents cannot exceed
        defined capabilities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Distinction Matters</h2>
    <p>
      These boundaries aren't pedantic. They reflect a specific architectural position:
      governance sits beneath orchestration, not alongside it. This position enables
      enforcement that orchestrators cannot override.
    </p>
    <p>
      When governance is a feature of the orchestrator, it can be bypassed by the
      orchestrator. When governance is the <em>foundation</em>, it cannot.
