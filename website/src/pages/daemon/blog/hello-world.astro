      <h1>Hello World: Introducing DaemonCore</h1>

<<<<<<< HEAD
        After months of development and refinement, we're ready to share DaemonCore
        with the world.
      </p>

      <h2>What We've Built</h2>
      <p>
        DaemonCore is an autonomous agent kernel — a structured framework that transforms
        how AI agents operate within human workflows. It's the missing infrastructure
        layer that makes AI assistants genuinely useful for complex, ongoing work.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Current AI tools are remarkably capable but frustratingly stateless. Every
        conversation starts fresh. There's no memory, no consistent behaviour, no
        safety boundaries that adapt to context.
      </p>
      <p>DaemonCore changes this. It provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Persistent context</strong> that survives across sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Deterministic boot sequences</strong> that ensure predictable behaviour</li>
        <li><strong>Safety scaling</strong> that matches permissions to trust levels</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-agent coordination</strong> for complex workflows</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Road Here</h2>
      <p>
        This project grew from a simple frustration: AI assistants that couldn't
        remember what we were working on. What started as a personal productivity
        hack evolved into a full kernel architecture as we discovered how much
        structure was needed to make AI agents truly reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kernel specification has been refined through real-world use across
        multiple projects. The patterns that survived are the ones that actually work.
      </p>

      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <p>
        We're publishing the public documentation and specification for review.
        The goal is to establish DaemonCore as a reference architecture for structured
        human-AI collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        A provisional patent application has been filed to protect the core innovations
        while we determine the right path forward for commercial use.
      </p>

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>
        Review the <a href="/daemon">documentation</a>, explore the
        <a href="/daemon/architecture">architecture</a>, and reach out if you're interested
        in collaboration or commercial licensing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future of AI assistance is structured, safe, and human-centred. DaemonCore
        is our contribution to making that future real.
=======
        DaemonCore grew out of a simple frustration: powerful AI tools that could not
        remember what we were doing from one session to the next. Every chat felt like
        starting from scratch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, that frustration turned into a clearer question: what would it look
        like if AI assistants had a proper <em>operating environment</em>, not just a
        text box?
      </p>

      <h2>From Experiments to a Kernel</h2>
      <p>
        Early experiments were nothing more than careful prompts and a few helper
        files. They worked for a while – until they didn’t. Small changes in wording
        or model behaviour could throw everything off.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more the system was used in real projects, the more obvious it became that
        a deeper layer was missing: a way to define how assistants start up, what they
        should pay attention to, and where the lines are.
      </p>

      <h2>What DaemonCore Tries to Do</h2>
      <p>DaemonCore focuses on a small set of goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>make assistant behaviour feel more predictable and repeatable;</li>
        <li>separate “who the assistant is” from “what it is allowed to do”;</li>
        <li>help multiple assistants stay aligned on the same stream of work; and</li>
        <li>keep humans firmly in control of scope and safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Part of a Bigger Picture</h2>
      <p>
        DaemonCore is one of the core building blocks of Stux OS – an operating system
        for running AI agents in your own environment. The intention is not to replace
        existing tools, but to give them a more stable foundation to plug into.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s Next</h2>
      <p>
        The immediate focus is on refining the DaemonCore ideas through practical
        use, sharing more examples, and exploring how different teams want to apply
        them. As that stabilises, additional Stux OS components will grow around the
        kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are interested in that journey, keep an eye on this space and on the
        public repository. This is still early work, but the direction is clear:
        AI assistants need an operating system, not just another window.
