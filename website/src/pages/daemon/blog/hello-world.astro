      <h1>Initialisation: Introducing Daemon Core</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        Daemon Core originated from an architectural problem: AI systems
        that could not maintain context across sessions. Each interaction
        began without memory. No continuity. No accumulated state.
      </p>

      <p>
        The question that emerged: what would a proper operating environment
        for AI agents look like? Not an interface. A substrate.
      </p>

      <h2>From Prompt to Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Initial attempts used careful prompting and configuration files.
        These worked intermittently. Small variations in model behavior
        or prompt phrasing produced inconsistent results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pattern became clear: prompt engineering addresses symptoms.
        The underlying problem is architectural. Agents need a defined
        operating environment, not just better instructions.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Objectives</h2>
      <p>Daemon Core addresses four core requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Predictable, repeatable agent behavior.</li>
        <li>Separation between agent identity and operational permissions.</li>
        <li>Coordination protocols for multi-agent systems.</li>
        <li>Human authority over scope and safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>System Context</h2>
      <p>
        Daemon Core forms the kernel layer of Stux OS, a broader operating
        environment for multi-agent computation. The kernel handles
        orchestration. Additional components will build on this foundation.
      </p>

      <h2>Development Direction</h2>
      <p>
        Current focus: specification refinement through production deployment.
        Public materials will expand as the architecture stabilises.
      </p>
      <p>
        The direction is clear: AI agents require an operating system layer.
        Daemon Core provides that foundation.
