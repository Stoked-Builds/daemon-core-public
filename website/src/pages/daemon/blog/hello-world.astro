      <h1>Hello World: Introducing DaemonCore</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        DaemonCore grew out of a simple frustration: powerful AI tools that could not
        remember what we were doing from one session to the next. Every chat felt like
        starting from scratch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, that frustration turned into a clearer question: what would it look
        like if AI assistants had a proper <em>operating environment</em>, not just a
        text box?
      </p>

      <h2>From Experiments to a Kernel</h2>
      <p>
        Early experiments were nothing more than careful prompts and a few helper
        files. They worked for a while – until they didn't. Small changes in wording
        or model behaviour could throw everything off.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more the system was used in real projects, the more obvious it became that
        a deeper layer was missing: a way to define how assistants start up, what they
        should pay attention to, and where the lines are.
      </p>

      <h2>What DaemonCore Tries to Do</h2>
      <p>DaemonCore focuses on a small set of goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>make assistant behaviour feel more predictable and repeatable;</li>
        <li>separate "who the assistant is" from "what it is allowed to do";</li>
        <li>help multiple assistants stay aligned on the same stream of work; and</li>
        <li>keep humans firmly in control of scope and safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Part of a Bigger Picture</h2>
      <p>
        DaemonCore is one of the core building blocks of Stux OS – an operating system
        for running AI agents in your own environment. The intention is not to replace
        existing tools, but to give them a more stable foundation to plug into.
      </p>

      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <p>
        The immediate focus is on refining the DaemonCore ideas through practical
        use, sharing more examples, and exploring how different teams want to apply
        them. As that stabilises, additional Stux OS components will grow around the
        kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are interested in that journey, keep an eye on this space and on the
        public repository. This is still early work, but the direction is clear:
        AI assistants need an operating system, not just another window.
