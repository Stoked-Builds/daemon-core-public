    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What is DaemonCore?</h2>
      <p>
        DaemonCore is a small kernel that runs underneath your AI assistants. It gives
        them a shared rulebook, a sense of scope, and a more consistent way of working
        across projects and environments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is DaemonCore an AI model?</h2>
      <p>
        No. DaemonCore does not replace or compete with the models you already use.
        It sits alongside them as an operating layer, shaping how they behave rather
        than what they are capable of in raw terms.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How is this different from "just prompting"?</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional prompting treats every conversation as a clean slate. DaemonCore
        assumes your work is ongoing. It:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>encourages a repeatable start-up process for assistants;</li>
        <li>keeps basic project and task context in view; and</li>
        <li>puts boundaries around what assistants should and should not touch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You still write prompts – but they run inside a more structured environment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Which AI providers can I use with DaemonCore?</h2>
      <p>
        The design is vendor-agnostic. It is intended to support a mix of popular
        providers over time, and to make it easier to switch or combine models without
        redesigning everything.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How does the safety side work?</h2>
      <p>
        At a high level, DaemonCore is opinionated about scope. It is built on the
        idea that assistants should be constrained by default, with clearer rules
        about where they are involved and when a human needs to stay in the loop.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What is the relationship to Stux OS?</h2>
      <p>
        Stux OS is the broader operating system for running AI agents in your own
        environment. DaemonCore is the kernel at its heart – the part that focuses on
        behaviour, boundaries, and coordination. Other Stux components will grow up
        around that core.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Can multiple assistants work together?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. DaemonCore is designed with multi-assistant workflows in mind. It provides
        a shared sense of context and simple coordination hooks so different assistants
        can work on the same stream of work over time without losing the thread.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Do I have to change how I call existing APIs?</h2>
      <p>
        No. DaemonCore is intended to sit alongside existing integrations and tooling.
        It focuses on how assistants are initialised and how context is managed, not
        on replacing your infrastructure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How can I follow progress?</h2>
      <p>
        The best way to keep an eye on DaemonCore is via the public materials and
        updates linked from the GitHub repository, along with occasional posts on
        the blog.
