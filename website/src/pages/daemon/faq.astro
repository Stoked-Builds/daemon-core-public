      <h2 class="faq-category">Understanding DaemonCore</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is DaemonCore?</h3>
        <p>
          DaemonCore is a governance layer for multi-agent AI systems. It sits beneath
          orchestration frameworks and defines what agents are allowed to do. Think of
          it as the "operating system layer" for AI — enforcing boundaries, managing
          permissions, and coordinating agent interactions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is DaemonCore an AI model?</h3>
        <p>
          No. DaemonCore is not an AI model, and it does not generate text, reason about problems,
          or produce outputs.
        </p>

        <p>
          DaemonCore provides the <strong>governance layer that exists within an agentic session</strong>.
          It defines the rules, constraints, and continuity under which models like Claude, GPT,
          or Gemini operate during that session — without being the thing that thinks or speaks.
        </p>

        <p>
          In other words, DaemonCore doesn’t replace AI models, and it doesn’t sit alongside them
          as a tool or wrapper. It shapes the <em>environment</em> they are operating in.
        </p>

        <p><strong>
          Orchestration tools tell models what to do.<br />
          DaemonCore defines the rules of the world they’re doing it in.
        </strong></p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is it an orchestrator or agent framework?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Orchestrators like LangChain and CrewAI coordinate agent workflows.
          DaemonCore operates <em>beneath</em> orchestrators, enforcing rules that
          orchestrators cannot override. It's complementary, not competitive.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is this different from prompt engineering?</h3>
        <p>
          Prompt engineering operates per-request with advisory guidelines.
          DaemonCore operates at the environment level with structural enforcement:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Boundaries persist across sessions</li>
          <li>Constraints cannot be bypassed by clever prompting</li>
          <li>Safety is architectural, not advisory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Prompts still exist — they execute <em>within</em> the governed environment.
        </p>

      <h2 class="faq-category">Technical Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Which AI providers are supported?</h3>
        <p>
          DaemonCore is vendor-agnostic by design. The governance layer works with
          any model provider — Claude, GPT, Gemini, open-source LLMs. Different
          providers operate under unified governance with strict isolation between them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does safety work?</h3>
        <p>
          Safety in DaemonCore is architectural, not advisory. Agents operate within
          defined capability envelopes — boundaries they cannot exceed regardless of
          prompting. The system enforces permissions based on environment trust level,
          with lower-trust environments receiving stricter constraints by default.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can multiple agents work together?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Multi-agent coordination is core functionality. DaemonCore manages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Context handoff between agents</li>
          <li>Scope isolation to prevent conflicts</li>
          <li>Shared state through defined protocols</li>
          <li>Permission inheritance across agent hierarchies</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does this require API changes to use existing models?</h3>
        <p>
          No. DaemonCore operates as a governance layer above model APIs. Your existing
          integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers remain unchanged.
          The governance layer wraps these interactions with enforcement.

      <h2 class="faq-category">Availability & Access</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is DaemonCore open source?</h3>
        <p>
          The kernel specification is public and available for review. The full system
          includes additional components in various stages of development. See the
          <a href="https://github.com/stux-os/daemon-core-public">GitHub repository</a>
          for current public materials.

      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I use it today?</h3>
        <p>
          The kernel specification is available for review and experimentation.
          Production deployment capabilities are in active development. Follow
          the blog for updates on availability.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the relationship to Stux OS?</h3>
        <p>
          DaemonCore is the kernel component of Stux OS. Stux OS provides the broader
          operating environment for multi-agent systems. DaemonCore specifically handles
          governance, boundaries, and coordination at the foundational layer.

          Public materials and specifications are available via the
          <a href="https://github.com/stux-os/daemon-core-public">GitHub repository</a>.

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="faq-category">Strategic Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does this matter now?</h3>
        <p>
          AI systems are being deployed at scale without governance infrastructure.
          As multi-agent systems become more capable, the gap between what agents
          <em>can</em> do and what they <em>should</em> do becomes critical.
          DaemonCore provides the foundation for trustworthy agent deployment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can't orchestrators handle safety themselves?</h3>
        <p>
          Governance at the orchestration layer can be bypassed by the orchestrator.
          For enforcement to be reliable, it must sit <em>beneath</em> orchestration —
          at a layer that orchestrators cannot override. This is why DaemonCore exists
          as a separate governance layer, not as a feature of existing frameworks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What about existing enterprise AI platforms?</h3>
        <p>
          Large technology companies have built sophisticated internal systems.
          DaemonCore provides a public specification that enables similar governance
          capabilities without requiring the massive engineering investment of building
          everything from scratch.
