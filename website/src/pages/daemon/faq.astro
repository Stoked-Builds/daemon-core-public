    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What is DaemonCore?</h2>
      <p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        DaemonCore is an autonomous agent kernel — a structured framework that governs
        how AI agents initialise, behave, and collaborate. It provides the "operating
        system" layer that transforms raw AI capabilities into disciplined, context-aware
        assistants.
=======
        DaemonCore is a small kernel that runs underneath your AI assistants. It gives
        them a shared rulebook, a sense of scope, and a more consistent way of working
        across projects and environments.

      <h2>Is DaemonCore an AI model?</h2>
      <p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        No. DaemonCore works <em>with</em> existing AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.).
        It provides the governance and context layer that makes these models more useful
        in structured workflows. Think of it as the difference between a CPU and an
        operating system.
=======
        No. DaemonCore does not replace or compete with the models you already use.
        It sits alongside them as an operating layer, shaping how they behave rather
        than what they are capable of in raw terms.

      <h2>How does DaemonCore differ from "just prompting"?</h2>
      <p>
        Prompting is stateless — each conversation starts fresh. DaemonCore provides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Persistent context</strong> that survives across sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Deterministic boot sequences</strong> that ensure consistent behaviour</li>
        <li><strong>Safety boundaries</strong> that adapt to the environment</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-agent coordination</strong> for complex workflows</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's the difference between typing commands one at a time and having an
        operating system that manages state, permissions, and processes.
=======
      <h2>How is this different from “just prompting”?</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional prompting treats every conversation as a clean slate. DaemonCore
        assumes your work is ongoing. It:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>encourages a repeatable start-up process for assistants;</li>
        <li>keeps basic project and task context in view; and</li>
        <li>puts boundaries around what assistants should and should not touch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You still write prompts – but they run inside a more structured environment.

      <h2>Which AI providers does DaemonCore support?</h2>
      <p>DaemonCore is designed to be vendor-agnostic. The current implementation includes support for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anthropic Claude (all variants)</li>
        <li>OpenAI GPT models (including o1/o3)</li>
        <li>Google Gemini</li>
        <li>DeepSeek</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The vendor isolation system allows new providers to be added without affecting
        existing configurations.
=======
      <h2>Which AI providers can I use with DaemonCore?</h2>
      <p>
        The design is vendor-agnostic. It is intended to support a mix of popular
        providers over time, and to make it easier to switch or combine models without
        redesigning everything.

      <h2>How does the safety system work?</h2>
      <p>
        DaemonCore implements "safety scaling" — the idea that agent permissions should
        match the trust level of the environment. A tightly sandboxed environment gets
        restricted permissions. A trusted development workstation gets more autonomy.
        This is controlled through two dimensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sandbox Level</strong> (Hard/Medium/Soft) — What operations are physically possible</li>
        <li><strong>Execution Mode</strong> (Sandbox/Controlled/Dangerous) — How much approval is required</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What's the relationship to Stux OS?</h2>
      <p>
        DaemonCore is a core component of the Stux platform. Stux OS is the broader
        operating system for agentic computing, and DaemonCore provides the kernel
        that governs agent behaviour. Other Stux components (SDK, Hub) will build on
        the foundation DaemonCore provides.
=======
      <h2>How does the safety side work?</h2>
      <p>
        At a high level, DaemonCore is opinionated about scope. It is built on the
        idea that assistants should be constrained by default, with clearer rules
        about where they are involved and when a human needs to stay in the loop.

<<<<<<< HEAD
      <h2>Can multiple agents work together?</h2>
      <p>Yes. DaemonCore includes a multi-agent coordination system with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An exchange bus for passing messages between agents</li>
        <li>Session locks to prevent conflicts</li>
        <li>Handover protocols for transferring context</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This enables workflows where different specialised agents handle different
        aspects of a task.
=======
      <h2>What is the relationship to Stux OS?</h2>
      <p>
        Stux OS is the broader operating system for running AI agents in your own
        environment. DaemonCore is the kernel at its heart – the part that focuses on
        behaviour, boundaries, and coordination. Other Stux components will grow up
        around that core.

<<<<<<< HEAD
      <h2>Is DaemonCore open source?</h2>
      <p>
        The kernel specification and public documentation are available for review.
        The project uses a dual-licensing approach: open for evaluation and non-commercial
        use, with commercial licensing available for production deployments. A provisional
        patent application has been filed to protect the core innovations.
=======
      <h2>Can multiple assistants work together?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. DaemonCore is designed with multi-assistant workflows in mind. It provides
        a shared sense of context and simple coordination hooks so different assistants
        can work on the same stream of work over time without losing the thread.

<<<<<<< HEAD
      <h2>Do I need to modify my AI provider setup?</h2>
      <p>
        No. DaemonCore operates as a context layer that gets loaded alongside your
        normal AI interactions. It doesn't require changes to API integrations or
        model configurations. It works by providing structured prompts and context
        that shape agent behaviour.
=======
      <h2>Do I have to change how I call existing APIs?</h2>
      <p>
        No. DaemonCore is intended to sit alongside existing integrations and tooling.
        It focuses on how assistants are initialised and how context is managed, not
        on replacing your infrastructure.

      <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
      <p>
        Start by reading the <a href="/daemon/overview">Overview</a> to understand the core
        concepts, then review the <a href="/daemon/architecture">Architecture</a> to see how
        the pieces fit together. The kernel specification provides the full technical
        detail for implementers.
=======
      <h2>How can I follow progress?</h2>
      <p>
        The best way to keep an eye on DaemonCore is via the public materials and
        updates linked from the GitHub repository, along with occasional posts on
        the blog.
