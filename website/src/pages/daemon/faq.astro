    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What is Daemon Core?</h2>
      <p>
        A kernel layer for AI agents. It provides structural constraints,
        context management, and coordination protocols. Agents operate
        within defined boundaries with predictable behavior.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is Daemon Core an AI model?</h2>
      <p>
        No. Daemon Core operates alongside existing models. It does not
        replace them. It provides the orchestration substrate they run on.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How does this differ from prompt engineering?</h2>
      <p>
        Prompt engineering operates per-request. Daemon Core operates at
        the environment level:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent context across sessions.</li>
        <li>Structural constraints, not advisory guidelines.</li>
        <li>Coordination protocols for multi-agent operation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Prompts still exist. They execute within the Daemon Core environment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Which AI providers are supported?</h2>
      <p>
        Architecture is vendor-agnostic. Current implementation supports
        multiple providers through isolated configuration. New providers
        integrate without restructuring existing deployments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How does safety work?</h2>
      <p>
        Safety is architectural. Agents operate under constraints determined
        by environment trust level. Higher-trust environments may receive
        expanded permissions. Lower-trust environments are restricted by default.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What is the relationship to Stux OS?</h2>
      <p>
        Daemon Core is the kernel component of Stux OS. Stux OS provides
        the broader operating environment for multi-agent systems.
        Daemon Core handles orchestration, boundaries, and coordination.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Can multiple agents work together?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Multi-agent coordination is core functionality:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Context handoff between agents.</li>
        <li>Scope isolation to prevent conflicts.</li>
        <li>Shared state through defined protocols.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Does this require API changes?</h2>
      <p>
        No. Daemon Core operates as an orchestration layer. Existing
        API integrations remain unchanged. The kernel manages context
        and coordination above the API level.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How can I follow development?</h2>
      <p>
        Public materials and specification available via GitHub repository.
        Development updates posted to the blog.
