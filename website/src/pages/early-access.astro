      <h1>Early Access</h1>
      <p class="ea-tagline">
        DaemonCore is in private development. We're selectively opening access
        to teams building production multi-agent systems.
        This is not a waitlist — it's a qualification process.

          <h3>Private Development</h3>
          <p>
            The kernel specification is public. The full system — runtime,
            tooling, and production components — is under active private
            development.

          <h3>Selective Access</h3>
          <p>
            Early access is granted to teams with real multi-agent use cases.
            We prioritise production deployments over experimentation.

          <p>
            Initial licences will be limited. This ensures we can provide
            proper support and incorporate feedback meaningfully.

        <h3>When will early access open?</h3>
        <p>
          We're targeting early 2026 for initial access. Timing depends on
          development progress and the readiness of supporting documentation.

      <div class="ea-faq-item">
        <h3>Is there a cost?</h3>

          Pricing has not been finalised. Early access participants may receive
          preferential terms. We'll communicate details when access opens.
