# Getting Started with DaemonCore

DaemonCore is the deterministic foundation beneath multi-agent intelligence. This guide walks you through the initial concepts and setup.

## What is DaemonCore?

DaemonCore orchestrates reasoning, distributes workloads, and refracts intent through a crystalline mesh of agents. It provides:

- **Deterministic execution** - Same inputs produce same outputs
- **Multi-agent coordination** - Agents work together without collision
- **Safety scaling** - Configurable autonomy and approval gates
- **Vendor isolation** - Clean separation between AI model providers

## Core Concepts

### The Kernel

The kernel is the core orchestration layer. It handles:

- Boot sequences and identity handshakes
- Environment reporting and profile application
- Vendor-scoped persona loading
- Session state management

### Agents

Agents are the working units within DaemonCore. Each agent:

- Declares its vendor and model identity
- Operates within a capability envelope
- Communicates via structured messaging
- Respects safety constraints and approval gates

### Profiles

Profiles define agent behaviour for specific contexts:

- **Host profiles** - Hardware-specific configurations (Laptop, Pi, Gaming-PC, Supercloud)
- **Role profiles** - Task-specific behaviours (developer, architect, sysadmin)
