## Meta Descriptions

**Homepage:**
> The governance layer beneath multi-agent intelligence. Not an orchestrator. Not a framework. The OS-level foundation.

**Kernel:**
> The autonomous agent kernel. Orchestration, isolation, and coordination for multi-agent systems.

**What It Is:**
> DaemonCore is the governance layer for multi-agent AI systems. It operates beneath orchestration frameworks.

**Early Access:**
> Register interest for early access to DaemonCore. Limited licences available for qualified teams building multi-agent systems.

**FAQ:**
> Frequently asked questions about DaemonCore: what it is, how it works, and how to get involved.

**Media Kit:**
> Press and creator resources for DaemonCore. Approved descriptions, diagrams, and usage guidelines.

## Short Descriptions

**One-liner:**
> DaemonCore is the governance layer for multi-agent AI systems.

**Two-liner:**
> DaemonCore provides the OS-level foundation for AI agents. It enforces safety boundaries and coordination rules that orchestrators cannot override.

**Paragraph:**
> DaemonCore is a governance layer that sits beneath orchestration frameworks. It defines what agents are allowed to do, enforces safety boundaries, and provides the structural foundation for multi-agent coordination. Unlike orchestrators that coordinate workflows, DaemonCore enforces the rules those workflows operate under.
