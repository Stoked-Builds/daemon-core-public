DaemonCore is a governance layer for multi-agent AI systems. It sits beneath
          orchestration frameworks and defines what agents are allowed to do. Think of
          it as the "operating system layer" for AI — enforcing boundaries, managing
          permissions, and coordinating agent interactions.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Is DaemonCore an AI model?</h3> <p>
No. DaemonCore is not an AI model, and it does not generate text, reason about problems,
          or produce outputs.
</p> <p>
DaemonCore provides the <strong>governance layer that exists within an agentic session</strong>.
          It defines the rules, constraints, and continuity under which models like Claude, GPT,
          or Gemini operate during that session — without being the thing that thinks or speaks.
</p> <p>
In other words, DaemonCore doesn’t replace AI models, and it doesn’t sit alongside them
          as a tool or wrapper. It shapes the <em>environment</em> they are operating in.
</p> <p><strong>
Orchestration tools tell models what to do.<br>
DaemonCore defines the rules of the world they’re doing it in.
</strong></p> <p class="muted">Patent pending.</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Is it an orchestrator or agent framework?</h3> <p>
No. Orchestrators like LangChain and CrewAI coordinate agent workflows.
          DaemonCore operates <em>beneath</em> orchestrators, enforcing rules that
          orchestrators cannot override. It's complementary, not competitive.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>How is this different from prompt engineering?</h3> <p>
Prompt engineering operates per-request with advisory guidelines.
          DaemonCore operates at the environment level with structural enforcement:
</p> <ul> <li>Boundaries persist across sessions</li> <li>Constraints cannot be bypassed by clever prompting</li> <li>Safety is architectural, not advisory</li> </ul> <p>
Prompts still exist — they execute <em>within</em> the governed environment.
</p> </div> </section> <section class="faq-section"> <h2 class="faq-category">Hard Questions</h2> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Isn't this just prompts with extra steps?</h3> <p>
A fair question. Here's the difference:
</p> <p>
Prompts are <strong>instructions to the model</strong>. DaemonCore defines
<strong>what happens to model outputs</strong> before they become actions.
</p> <ul> <li>Prompts: "Don't access files outside this directory"</li> <li>DaemonCore: Output must be protocol-shaped. Scope field validated. Access blocked if outside permitted paths.</li> </ul> <p>
The model still receives prompts. But its outputs pass through protocol validation
          before any action occurs. A prompt can be ignored or misinterpreted. A schema
          mismatch is rejected.
</p> <p> <strong>V1:</strong> Protocol validation, schema enforcement, scope checking.
          The model's reasoning is still its own—we govern what that reasoning can <em>do</em>.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Can prompt injection override DaemonCore?</h3> <p> <strong>Honest answer:</strong> In V1, prompt injection can influence the model's reasoning.
          It cannot bypass the governance layer.
</p> <p>
Here's what that means:
</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Injection can:</strong> Manipulate the model into producing malicious output,
            changing its reasoning, or attempting actions outside scope.
</li> <li> <strong>Injection cannot:</strong> Make that output bypass protocol validation,
            send messages that don't match schema, or access resources outside permitted scope.
</li> </ul> <p>
If a manipulated model tries to access <code>src/payments/</code> when only
<code>src/auth/</code> is permitted, the access is blocked. The violation is logged.
          The model was influenced; the action was prevented.
</p> <p> <strong>V1:</strong> Detection and constraint. We log anomalous outputs and block
          out-of-scope actions.
</p> <p> <strong>V1.5 (planned):</strong> Cryptographic action signing, hardware attestation.
          Stronger guarantees that actions trace to legitimate requests.
</p> <p>
We don't claim to prevent prompt injection. We limit what a compromised model can achieve.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Don't orchestration tools already do this?</h3> <p>
Orchestrators coordinate. They decide <em>what</em> agents do, <em>when</em>,
          and in what order. Some include safety features.
</p> <p>
The problem: governance at the orchestration layer can be bypassed by the orchestrator.
          If the orchestrator decides to skip a check, nothing prevents it.
</p> <p>
DaemonCore sits <em>beneath</em> orchestration. The orchestrator cannot override
          governance because it operates above the governance layer. This is the same principle
          as OS-level memory protection: applications cannot decide to bypass it because
          enforcement happens at a lower level.
</p> <p> <strong>Orchestrators + DaemonCore:</strong> The orchestrator coordinates workflows.
          DaemonCore ensures those workflows operate within defined boundaries regardless of
          what the orchestrator requests.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>What's actually enforced in V1 vs V1.5?</h3> <div class="faq-version-table"> <div class="faq-version-col"> <h4>V1 (Current)</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Protocol validation:</strong> Outputs must match expected structure</li> <li><strong>Schema enforcement:</strong> Messages validated against typed schemas</li> <li><strong>Scope boundaries:</strong> File/resource access checked against permissions</li> <li><strong>Template constraints:</strong> Operations follow predefined templates</li> <li><strong>Deterministic boot:</strong> Agents initialise with consistent context</li> <li><strong>Audit logging:</strong> Actions and violations recorded</li> </ul> </div> <div class="faq-version-col"> <h4>V1.5 (Planned)</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Cryptographic signing:</strong> Actions carry verifiable signatures</li> <li><strong>Hardware attestation:</strong> Trusted execution environment support</li> <li><strong>Capability delegation:</strong> Cross-agent permission transfer with audit</li> <li><strong>Real-time verification:</strong> Continuous constraint checking during execution</li> </ul> </div> </div> <p>
V1 provides structural enforcement through validation and rejection. V1.5 adds
          cryptographic guarantees. We ship what's working; we don't promise what's not built.
</p> </div> </section> <section class="faq-section"> <h2 class="faq-category">Technical Questions</h2> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Which AI providers are supported?</h3> <p>
DaemonCore is vendor-agnostic by design. The governance layer works with
          any model provider — Claude, GPT, Gemini, open-source LLMs. Different
          providers operate under unified governance with strict isolation between them.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>How does safety work?</h3> <p>
Safety in DaemonCore is architectural, not advisory. Agents operate within
          defined capability envelopes — boundaries they cannot exceed regardless of
          prompting. The system enforces permissions based on environment trust level,
          with lower-trust environments receiving stricter constraints by default.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Can multiple agents work together?</h3> <p>
Yes. Multi-agent coordination is core functionality. DaemonCore manages:
</p> <ul> <li>Context handoff between agents</li> <li>Scope isolation to prevent conflicts</li> <li>Shared state through defined protocols</li> <li>Permission inheritance across agent hierarchies</li> </ul> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Does this require API changes to use existing models?</h3> <p>
No. DaemonCore operates as a governance layer above model APIs. Your existing
          integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers remain unchanged.
          The governance layer wraps these interactions with enforcement.
</p> </div> </section> <section class="faq-section"> <h2 class="faq-category">Availability & Access</h2> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Is DaemonCore open source?</h3> <p>
The kernel specification is public and available for review. The full system
          includes additional components in various stages of development. See the
<a href="https://github.com/stux-os/daemon-core-public">GitHub repository</a>
for current public materials.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Can I use it today?</h3> <p>
The kernel specification is available for review and experimentation.
          Production deployment capabilities are in active development. Follow
          the blog for updates on availability.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>What is Stux, and how does it relate to DaemonCore?</h3> <p> <strong>Stux</strong> is the company building DaemonCore. Think of it like the
          relationship between a company and its core product.
</p> <p> <strong>Stux OS</strong> is the broader operating environment we're building for
          multi-agent systems. DaemonCore is the kernel—the governance layer at the foundation.
          Other components (tooling, interfaces, deployment systems) build on top of the kernel.
</p> <p>
When you see "DaemonCore," you're looking at the core governance specification.
          When you see "Stux," you're looking at the organisation and broader ecosystem.

</p> </div> </section> <section class="faq-section"> <h2 class="faq-category">Strategic Questions</h2> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Why does this matter now?</h3> <p>
AI systems are being deployed at scale without governance infrastructure.
          As multi-agent systems become more capable, the gap between what agents
<em>can</em> do and what they <em>should</em> do becomes critical.
          DaemonCore provides the foundation for trustworthy agent deployment.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>Can't orchestrators handle safety themselves?</h3> <p>
Governance at the orchestration layer can be bypassed by the orchestrator.
          For enforcement to be reliable, it must sit <em>beneath</em> orchestration —
          at a layer that orchestrators cannot override. This is why DaemonCore exists
          as a separate governance layer, not as a feature of existing frameworks.
</p> </div> <div class="faq-item"> <h3>What about existing enterprise AI platforms?</h3> <p>
Large technology companies have built sophisticated internal systems.
          DaemonCore provides a public specification that enables similar governance
          capabilities without requiring the massive engineering investment of building
          everything from scratch.
